  <p style="text-align:left">Welcome! You are soon to set off on a voyage to the distant planet of <em> <strong>Ginuli</strong></em>. </p> 
  <p>Before you leave, however, you must learn about its inhabitants and the language they speak.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> The planet is inhabited by two species of alien, the <em> <strong> Nulus </strong> </em> and the <em><strong> Gilis</strong></em>.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> They look quite different from each other, but they have a lot in common.
  <p style="text-align:left"> For instance, they wear the same clothing and speak the same language.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> On the next couple of screens we'll introduce you to the Nulus and Gilis and the different ceremonial outfits that they both wear.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:left"> Click 'Next' when you are ready.</p>
